# Movie-Ticket-System
This Movie Ticketing System is a console-based application that enables users to book, cancel, and check the availability of movie tickets for various movies. The system uses a class called Movie, which holds details like the movie name, show time, show date, ticket price, and a 10x10 grid representing the seats in the cinema. The seats are initialized to 0 (unbooked), and the system allows users to perform the following actions:

View available movies with their show timings and ticket prices.
Book a seat by providing the movie name and seat coordinates.
Cancel a booking by providing the movie name and seat coordinates.
Check the number of available seats for a particular movie. Each movie instance maintains its own seat availability and booking information, and the system handles these tasks interactively through a simple text-based interface.
